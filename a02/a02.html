            <article>YoungBoy Never Broke Again continued his run of chart-topping albums with 2021's Sincerely, Kentrell, his third official full-length album and fourth Billboard 200 number one. Preceded by five Hot 100-charting singles, including the Top 40
                hit "On My Side," the album is filled with confessional, soul-baring tracks about violence, jail time, and his quest for redemption.</article>

                No guest rappers are featured, making the lyrics as pure an expression of YoungBoy's feelings as possible, while the huge cast of producers includes Mike WiLL Made-It, Smash David, and Einer Bankz. Sincerely, Kentrell is a record that is sure to be a
                hit with fans and critics alike.
